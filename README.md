This is an Agentic AI solution which was built to save the time of manual testers who used to write test cases based on the user-manual given to them 
which consisted of the various details about the Client's B2B(any sort of) applications. Here we have a Junior Q/A Agent who writes test cases based on
it's understanding from the user manual and a Senior Q/A Agent who validates those cases and gives a feedback. The outputs from both of the Q/A Agent's 
will be generated and saved as 'agent_cot_output.txt' and 'test_cases_final_results.txt' respectively which will be having the above said output from both of
them. These files will be generated in the same folder where this script was run. The manual testers may use these files to just validate and make the
necessary changes alone instead of studying the entire user-manual, understanding it and writing test-cases from scratch. This made the manual testers around
4x-5x more productive. 

**NOTE:** The jupyter-notebook version of the script is uploaded for easy tracking and understanding of the code and the AI Workflow.
